#### Notes

If you are thinking about an isolated point in time in the future - 6 months is the rough figure I've thrown out because it aws put out 6 months ago and its made a substantial amount of progress so in the next 6 months. In the next 6 months if elos has an app it will be written in swift.

It was rushed out of the door, execs wanted something, wasn't quite ready yet. Allows for functional design. Big fan of these days. Also seems like it's a logic puzzel right, if you think about would prefer web or native, native is just more conducive to what we are trying to do. And I think we prefer android over iphone so we can use them more easily to dog food. I also believe that when we have an app in 6 months we will be glad that we started in swift and don't have to import classes and rewrite everything. Whether or not we start the app immediately, that's another question, but when we do have an iPhone app it will be written in swift.

and swift is getting better every day, every day you see improvements in the library and pretty consistent updates to the swift compiler itself. 

Nick: Ok so yeah I would to hear what you have to think on like working in the swift app environment now working.

Sam: Ok today now the hardest thing for me is moving forward without like knowledge of best practices. I don't mind that xcode crashes every so often, I don't mind really that it takes  a little bit of time to compile. Those are things that I'm not really worried about but I'm not entirely certain that what I am doing is the correct thing do.

Nick: yeah yea

Sam: before I was in that space I didn't even know that such things existed. this is the first time I'm in a langauge for which the best usage practices are not known. But at the end of the day it just time.

Nick: So then, is worth elos's time to try to figure those out. We have worked in uncertain envs before, with like the web and stuf but I guess ther ewas always

Sam: the key difference is that back then we were just ignorant of the best practices. We didn't know we were doing things wrong. Sorry I'm getting a feedback over cell

recall

Nick: ok so, right we didn't know, but do we have enough know-how now to figure out swift. I know taht's an impossible question. What's your read.

Sam: What really needs to happen is I just need to buckle up and right something I fell like I'm paralyzed with doubt. 

Nick: That's pretty positive. I totally agree with what you're saying because I feel the often about go. Analysis paralysis is killer.

Sam: yeah.

Nick: This is another stupid question. No it honestly is. What are the next three steps for elos on swift

Sam: so the primary goal, oh,, well that's the other wierd thing is a lot of the problems are interlaced. Steps 1 and 2 connect.

1. websocket connect to server
2. local persistence
they are tandem problems both hard in themselve

Nick: how ridiculous is just doing everything in memory for now?

Sam: uhh...not very ridiculous, although I am not sure how big a downside it is because I haven't researched it as much but transition to something mroe concrete might be a little rough.
