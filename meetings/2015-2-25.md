#### Notes

If you are thinking about an isolated point in time in the future - 6 months is the rough figure I've thrown out because it aws put out 6 months ago and its made a substantial amount of progress so in the next 6 months. In the next 6 months if elos has an app it will be written in swift.

It was rushed out of the door, execs wanted something, wasn't quite ready yet. Allows for functional design. Big fan of these days. Also seems like it's a logic puzzel right, if you think about would prefer web or native, native is just more conducive to what we are trying to do. And I think we prefer android over iphone so we can use them more easily to dog food. I also believe that when we have an app in 6 months we will be glad that we started in swift and don't have to import classes and rewrite everything. Whether or not we start the app immediately, that's another question, but when we do have an iPhone app it will be written in swift.
