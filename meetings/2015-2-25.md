#### Notes

**Nick:** Swift. Status?

**Sam:** If you are thinking about an isolated point in time in the future - 6 months is the rough figure I've thrown out because it swift was releassed 6 months ago and it has made a substantial amount of progress so it should make more in the next 6 months. In the next 6 months if elos has an app it will be written in swift.

It was rushed out of the door, apple execs wanted something, wasn't quite ready yet. Allows for functional design. Big fan of functional these days. Also seems like it's a logic puzzel right, if you think about would prefer web or native, native is just more conducive to what we are trying to do. And I think we prefer iphone over android so we can use more easily to dog food. I also believe that when we have an app in 6 months we will be glad that we started in swift and don't have to import classes and rewrite everything. Whether or not we start the app immediately, that's another question, but when we do have an iPhone app it will be written in swift.

and swift is getting better every day, every day you see improvements in the library and pretty consistent updates to the swift compiler itself. 

**Nick:** Ok so yeah I would to hear what you have to think on like working in the swift app environment now working.

**Sam:** Ok today now the hardest thing for me is moving forward without like knowledge of best practices. I don't mind that xcode crashes every so often, I don't mind really that it takes  a little bit of time to compile. Those are things that I'm not really worried about but I'm not entirely certain that what I am doing is the correct thing do.

**Nick:** yeah yea

**Sam:** before I was in that space I didn't even know that such things existed. this is the first time I'm in a langauge for which the best usage practices are not known. But at the end of the day it just time.

**Nick:** So then, is worth elos's time to try to figure those out. We have worked in uncertain envs before, with like the web and stuf but I guess ther ewas always

**Sam:** the key difference is that back then we were just ignorant of the best practices. We didn't know we were doing things wrong. Sorry I'm getting a feedback over cell

re-call

**Nick:** ok so, right we didn't know, but do we have enough know-how now to figure out swift. I know taht's an impossible question. What's your read.

**Sam:** What really needs to happen is I just need to buckle up and right something I fell like I'm paralyzed with doubt. 

**Nick:** That's pretty positive. I totally agree with what you're saying because I feel the often about go. Analysis paralysis is killer.

**Sam:** yeah.

**Nick:** This is another stupid question. No it honestly is. What are the next three steps for elos on swift

**Sam:** so the primary goal, oh,, well that's the other wierd thing is a lot of the problems are interlaced. Steps 1 and 2 connect.

1. websocket connect to server
2. local persistence
they are tandem problems both hard in themselve

**Nick:** how ridiculous is just doing everything in memory for now?

**Sam:** uhh...not very ridiculous, although I am not sure how big a downside it is because I haven't researched it as much but transition to something mroe concrete might be a little rough.

**Sam:** Ok so one more point that relates to the other one is uh, about the in memory store is that there is a lot of  things you can do in memory that would take some creativity or rewrites to get write.

**Nick:** ok yeah, wait is core data not in swift.

**Sam:** oh yeah well core data sucks...is my opinion. And I have read blogs and tweets from very experienced developers who have trouble with it so I tend away from it if that makes sense. The other two contenders. 1 is SQL light which is ok. The other is realm, recent YC batch still beta software guaranteed free, so that's not a problem. It seems to be more of like an active record style memory management thing. something that I am familiar with and makes a lot of sense to me. Plus notifications on save and on update. That would pray pretty nicely with reactive cocoa in my mind which signals ans streams and reactive programming.

**Nick:** Ok so speaking of reactive cocoa and reactive UI what's the status in swift. How's that going? 

**Sam:** They just landed some pretty significant PRs just this past week that looked pretty good. I'm not familiar enough with the library to understand how much work is left but they seem to be making some pretty good progress. I've also been listening to build phase which is thoughtbot's iOS podcast and they are super big fans of reactive cocoa and they've been using swift in production for a few months now and they haven't had any problems at scale which seems promising.

**Nick:** Sorry I'm delayed for a long time but I think this is good to have. I have this sort of cynicism about dependencies now I see them as liabilities. Which is sad in a sense but I think you need enterprise backing.. iwant to hear that github is backing reactive cocoa because they are basing there product on it

**Sam:** right so there entire mac app is reactive cocoa and they had 5 commits on the swift branch today so that's all I have to go off of but it seems ppretty good.

**Nick:** So to wrap up swift. What's our resolution. ok so let's actually turn the discussion to like the repl and the other possibilities of initial ui.

**Nick:** explains repl

I couldn't keep up typing. The rest of the conversation consisted in talking about repl, the fact that it's done and can be connected to over a websocket now as a part of the core elos api. 

More talk about samcal getting going on Swift and me continuing on backend. A bit of talk on dynamic ontology.
